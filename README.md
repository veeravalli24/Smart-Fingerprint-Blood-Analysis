Determining blood type is essential including in emergency situation. Currently, these 
tests are performed manually by technicians, which can lead to human errors. Various 
systems have been developed to automate these tests, but none is able to perform the 
analysis in time for emergency situations. The project aims to address the need for 
efficient and accurate blood typing methods in healthcare settings. The project utilizes 
pre-acquired palm images obtained through sensors. These images serve as inputs for 
the proposed system. Initially, the images undergo preprocessing to enhance quality 
and remove noise, ensuring optimal analysis. Feature extraction methods are then 
applied to discern distinctive patterns associated with different blood groups from the 
palm images. Subsequently, machine learning algorithms such as support vector 
machines (SVM) Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) are trained on a dataset 
comprising labeled palm images and corresponding blood groups. The proposed 
system offers several advantages over manual blood typing methods, including speed, 
objectivity, and scalability. Moreover, its non-invasive nature reduces the risk of 
contamination and ensures patient safety. This mini project contributes to advancing 
healthcare technologies, with potential applications in blood transfusion services, 
clinical laboratories, and emergency medical care.
